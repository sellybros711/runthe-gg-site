# Repo conventions

## Never use em dashes or en dashes

No `—`, no `–`, anywhere. Not in copy the player reads, not in placeholder
strings, not in code comments, not in `<title>` tags, not in commit messages,
not in PR descriptions. The same goes for the entities and escapes that produce
them: `&mdash;`, `&ndash;`, `&#8212;`, `&#8211;`, `—`, `–`.

This is not a style preference to weigh against readability. It is a hard rule.
If a sentence seems to need one, the sentence needs rewriting.

**Write this instead**, in rough order of how often it is the right answer:

| Instead of | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| explanation or naming | a colon | `Freshness 40/100: starting to go stale` |
| a second full sentence | a full stop | `Rep is there. You need OVR 62.` |
| a clause starting "and", "but", "so" | a comma | `You showboated, and paid for it.` |
| a genuine aside | parentheses | `(the bars above are damage taken, not lives)` |
| a number range | a hyphen | `out 1-8 weeks`, `elite 88-96` |
| fields on one line | a middot `·` | `CDP · Indie Circuit · Year 1` |
| a fragment the dash was propping up | nothing | delete it and close the gap |

Two dashes in one sentence (`X — like this — Y`) almost always wants commas or
parentheses, never one of each.

### Enforcement

```
node scripts/check-dashes.mjs
```

Exits non-zero and prints `file:line` for every offender. It runs in CI on any
push or pull request touching `wrestling/**` (`.github/workflows/dash-check.yml`).

The guarded list inside that script is currently just `wrestling/`. The rest of
the repo predates the rule and still contains hundreds of em dashes; add a
directory to `GUARDED` only after cleaning it, never before, or the check
becomes noise people learn to ignore.

Run the checker against anything ad hoc:

```
node scripts/check-dashes.mjs path/to/file-or-dir
```

## The wrestling game

`wrestling/index.html` is the whole career game in one self-contained file, by
site convention (the golf game at `golf/index.html` is the model). A name
collision anywhere in that script kills the entire thing, and the browser only
reports the symptom (`X is not defined`), so after editing:

```
python3 -c "
import re
s=open('wrestling/index.html').read()
b=max(re.findall(r'<script[^>]*>(.*?)</script>',s,re.S),key=len)
open('/tmp/x.js','w').write(b)
" && node --check /tmp/x.js
```

The game is unlisted: not linked from the homepage, nav or sitemap, and
noindexed. Keep it that way unless asked.

## Segue, the setlist game

`setlist/index.html`, same one-file convention. It is NOT in the same state as
the wrestling game above and the difference is deliberate, so it is written
down here rather than inferred from that paragraph:

| | wrestling | setlist |
|---|---|---|
| in `sitemap.xml` | no | **yes** |
| indexable | no, noindexed | **yes** |
| linked from the homepage or nav | no | no |

So Segue is live and findable by search, and a visitor browsing runthe.gg will
not stumble on it. Linking it from the homepage is the step that launches it,
and it has not been taken. `check_data.mjs` asserts all three of those, so
changing any of them means changing a guard on purpose.

It has its own regression suite, which is the thing to run after editing:

```
node scripts/setlist/check_data.mjs
node setlist/verify-scoring.mjs
```

Its data refreshes itself daily at 6am Eastern
(`.github/workflows/setlist-data.yml`) and commits three files:
`goose.csv` (performances), `goose_shows.csv` (every show, past and future,
with tour names) and `goose_latest.json` (last night's setlist plus the next
three dates, for the home screen). A refresh is not an append: song esteem is
derived, so one new show restates thousands of rows and the commit diff can
never be the review. The gates are.
