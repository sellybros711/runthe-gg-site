# Repo conventions

## Never use em dashes or en dashes

No `—`, no `–`, anywhere. Not in copy the player reads, not in placeholder
strings, not in code comments, not in `<title>` tags, not in commit messages,
not in PR descriptions. The same goes for the entities and escapes that produce
them: `&mdash;`, `&ndash;`, `&#8212;`, `&#8211;`, `—`, `–`.

This is not a style preference to weigh against readability. It is a hard rule.
If a sentence seems to need one, the sentence needs rewriting.

**Write this instead**, in rough order of how often it is the right answer:

| Instead of | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| explanation or naming | a colon | `Freshness 40/100: starting to go stale` |
| a second full sentence | a full stop | `Rep is there. You need OVR 62.` |
| a clause starting "and", "but", "so" | a comma | `You showboated, and paid for it.` |
| a genuine aside | parentheses | `(the bars above are damage taken, not lives)` |
| a number range | a hyphen | `out 1-8 weeks`, `elite 88-96` |
| fields on one line | a middot `·` | `CDP · Indie Circuit · Year 1` |
| a fragment the dash was propping up | nothing | delete it and close the gap |

Two dashes in one sentence (`X — like this — Y`) almost always wants commas or
parentheses, never one of each.

### Enforcement

```
node scripts/check-dashes.mjs
```

Exits non-zero and prints `file:line` for every offender. It runs in CI on any
push or pull request touching `wrestling/**` (`.github/workflows/dash-check.yml`).

The guarded list inside that script is currently just `wrestling/`. The rest of
the repo predates the rule and still contains hundreds of em dashes; add a
directory to `GUARDED` only after cleaning it, never before, or the check
becomes noise people learn to ignore.

Run the checker against anything ad hoc:

```
node scripts/check-dashes.mjs path/to/file-or-dir
```

## Sibling scripts carry a hand-written cache version

The game pages load their engine and run loop as separate files:

```
<script src="engine.js?v=52"></script>
```

`index.html` revalidates on every visit and those files do not. Change one and leave
the number alone and a RETURNING visitor gets the new page against the script they
already had. It fails on their phone, mid-run, and on nobody's development machine,
because a developer's browser has never seen the old file. It has shipped that way
once already, as `E.overallOf is not a function` in the main game.

So a change to one of those files is three things in one commit: the edit, the bump,
and the record.

```
node scripts/check-cachebust.mjs            # verify
node scripts/check-cachebust.mjs --update   # after bumping
```

It runs in CI on any push or pull request touching an `.html` or `.js` file
(`.github/workflows/cachebust-check.yml`), and it covers every page on the site that
versions a script beside it, found rather than listed.

## The wrestling game

`wrestling/index.html` is the whole career game in one self-contained file, by
site convention (the golf game at `golf/index.html` is the model). A name
collision anywhere in that script kills the entire thing, and the browser only
reports the symptom (`X is not defined`), so after editing:

```
python3 -c "
import re
s=open('wrestling/index.html').read()
b=max(re.findall(r'<script[^>]*>(.*?)</script>',s,re.S),key=len)
open('/tmp/x.js','w').write(b)
" && node --check /tmp/x.js
```

The game is unlisted: not linked from the homepage, nav or sitemap, and
noindexed. Keep it that way unless asked.

## Segue, the setlist game

`setlist/index.html`, same one-file convention. It is NOT in the same state as
the wrestling game above and the difference is deliberate, so it is written
down here rather than inferred from that paragraph:

| | wrestling | setlist |
|---|---|---|
| in `sitemap.xml` | no | **yes** |
| indexable | no, noindexed | **yes** |
| linked from the homepage or nav | no | no |

So Segue is live and findable by search, and a visitor browsing runthe.gg will
not stumble on it. Linking it from the homepage is the step that launches it,
and it has not been taken. `check_data.mjs` asserts all three of those, so
changing any of them means changing a guard on purpose.

It has its own regression suite, which is the thing to run after editing:

```
node scripts/setlist/check_data.mjs
node setlist/verify-scoring.mjs
```

## Run The Floor, the NBA game

`hoops/`, at `/hoops/`. The football and college football skeleton reskinned for
basketball, and the direct sibling of `baseball/`, which is the previous reskin
of the same thing. Unlike the two one-file games above, it is split the way the
football and college games are: `engine.js` and `run.js` load beside the page and
carry cache versions, so **read the cache-busting section above before editing
either**.

It is an **unlaunched preview**, on the same footing as the wrestling game:

| | wrestling | hoops | setlist |
|---|---|---|---|
| in `sitemap.xml` | no | no | **yes** |
| indexable | no, noindexed | no, noindexed | **yes** |
| carries the AdSense tag | no | no | yes |
| linked from the homepage or nav | no | no | no |

That noindex is doing more work than it looks like. `scripts/check-adsense.mjs`
audits every INDEXABLE page and skips noindexed ones, so the robots tag is the
only thing keeping an unfinished game out of the surface AdSense reviews. Remove
it and nothing fails: hoops silently becomes the 32nd indexable page, and the
checker then starts demanding an ad tag on it. `hoops/check-posture.mjs` asserts
all four rows of that column, so launching the game means editing a guard on
purpose.

The regression suite, none of which needs a network:

```
node hoops/check-posture.mjs      discoverability, per the table above
node hoops/build/check-fetch.mjs  the scraper's parsers, against saved markup
node hoops/verify.mjs             draft legality, seed replay, and calibration
```

`verify.mjs` prints a **TARGETS** block. Read it after any change to the data or
the constants: it states what the balance is supposed to look like and flags what
is outside its band. Two targets are deliberately out of band today, because the
data is a hand-entered seed. See `hoops/build/README.md`.

The data is **not real yet**. `hoops/data/players.json` is built from
`hoops/build/seed-rosters.mjs`, 171 player-seasons entered from memory and
rounded, and nothing in it should be shown to a player as a fact about a real
season. The real pipeline is written and needs Basketball-Reference, which is
blocked from the dev sandbox and open in CI, exactly as `build-register.mjs`
documents.

## Segue's data

Its data refreshes itself daily at 6am Eastern
(`.github/workflows/setlist-data.yml`) and commits three files:
`goose.csv` (performances), `goose_shows.csv` (every show, past and future,
with tour names) and `goose_latest.json` (last night's setlist plus the next
three dates, for the home screen). A refresh APPENDS: song esteem is derived
but its ceiling is pinned, so adding a show touches the rows it adds plus any
song a curator wrote up, and nothing else. `data_drift.mjs` enforces that,
failing any refresh where a derived value moved for a song whose own history
did not.
